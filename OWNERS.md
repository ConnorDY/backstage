# Reviewers

The project also contains a team called
[@backstage/reviewers](https://github.com/orgs/backstage/teams/reviewers). This
is the group of people who are the fallback in
[`CODEOWNERS`](./.github/CODEOWNERS). It will typically contain the
maintainers, and a number of additional people who are permitted to approve and
merge pull requests. This responsibility is distinct from the maintainer role;
see [`GOVERNANCE.md`](./GOVERNANCE.md) for the details of how this works.
